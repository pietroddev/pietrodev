        <h2>Projects</h2>
        
        <h3>Movement Parkour Game : Parkourio</h3>
        <p>This mini game was made on the Unity Engine and the goal of it was more for me to learn about this game engine.</p>
        <p>I ended up making it like a platformer game where you can do various types of movements from sliding to jumping to grappling and more.</p>
        <p>There was no specific goal for making this but i had fun in the proccess.</p>

        <h3>Top Down RPG : He-ll</h3>
        <p>This game was made on the GoDot Engine and the goal of it was to create a cozy adventure rpg game and learn about the creation of 2D games.</p>
        <p>My goals were simple , try and recreate all things a normal RPG 2D game would offer for the players , from day/night cycle to animations and interactions and finally fighting.</p>
        <p>It was a good experience and it was easier to work and understand than Unity.</p>

        <h3>Cookie Clicker Simulator : (no name) </h3>
        <p>This mini game was made using Eclipse with the JavaFX add-on.</p>
        <p>This game was made by me and my friend for our Java OOP class project.</p>
        <p>The goal was pretty basic , it was more focused on a Login account saving and score displaying , it was a cool experience to work on a game with someone else.</p>
